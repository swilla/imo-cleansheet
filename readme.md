# Imo Cleansheet

Imo Cleansheet cleans up the imo interface by changing fonts for readbility and enhancing some of the ui elements.

## Features

- Allows custom background image of whatever you'd like (find the `div#imo` style and change image url)
- Allows standardizing of font colors for outgoing and incoming messages
- Adds font spacing and padding in buddy window to be more readable
- Rounds buddy window edges for smoothability
- Buddy list dims when mouse is not hovered over it
- Buddy list group names are smaller to condense buddy list window more
- Removed down arrows on buddy list groups since you can click anywhere to shrink / expand
- Option to hide timestamp on messages or defaults to hiding seconds only (uncomment the `.convlog-msgs .ts` style)
- Other minor enhancements: Bold Buddy name in title bar, New Apps tab is not diff color, footer bar is darker

## Future Improvement

I hope to make more changes when I get the time, but would gladly appreciate any help anyone wants to send my way. If you have any changes, please fork and submit a pull request. The only requirements I ask is to make changes easy to understand (comments in your CSS code) and available for others to modify if they prefer something different.
